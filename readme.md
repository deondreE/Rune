Bringing speed back to modern editors. Rune is simple and effective at any task you throw at it.

## Developement

Speed is the number one priority as well as keeping the bundle size pretty small, eventually we will stick to native rendering methods per platform, but for now we are stuck on SDL3.

## Install steps

MacOS
`brew install odin SDL3 SDL3_ttf SDL3_image`

> Rune is pre-Alpha software use at your own risk.

Rune will run the [LSP Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).
